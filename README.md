# leaflet-challenge

This repo contains project files relating to the leaflet challenge assignment. The objective of the challenge was to utilize data from the USGS in combination with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a map of earthquakes. The goal was to not only plot the location of the earthquake, but to indicate its depth and magnitude by the size and color of the plotted circle.

The code used to create the logic for this map can be found within the static/js/ folder of this repository and is entitled "logic.js". The HTML code used to control the web functionality can be found in the form of an index.html file in the root folder of this repository. The CSS code used to stylize the map can be found within the static/css folder of this repository.
